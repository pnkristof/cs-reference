This tiny App contains a set of locations, like contries, rivers, cities and more, 
stored in an XML file.
There is 8 tasks, all of them is some kind of filtering.
For most of the solutions, I used Linq.

The tasks are the following:

1st Task
Find the contry with the highest density.

2nd Task
Find all the democratic contries.

3rd Task
Count the ethnic and religional groups of every country, and order it descending.

4th Task
Measure the borders of the countries.

5th Task
Count the occurence of every river and order it descending.

6th Task

7th Task
Find rivers end in a see.

8th Task
Get all the ethnic groups.
