Tha basic function of the App is to generate a Bitmap (.bmp) file from a .hgt file.

An HGT file contains height data of a territory. 
It is stored in signed two byte integers, in big-endian order.

More about HGT: https://fileinfo.com/extension/hgt

You can run the app from console, with three arguments. If you run it without arguments,
it will ask for them during running.

The arguments are:
1. input.hgt - the HGT file
2. elevation threshold (int) - an integer (meter), below the value there is water
and land above
3. output.bmp - the name of the output bitmap file 

The bitmap file will be two-colored: blue and green. 
The part below the treshold will be blue, above will be green (higher is darker).

The bin/Debug directory contains samples, exactly the lake Balaton, with treshold 100.
